# IMTneLaTeX

## Goal
This created to provide IMT Nord Europe students with a LaTeX template they can use to easily write their report

## Credits
To write this template I edited the one written by @Afoucaul @bporteboeuf and @dimtion to match IMT Nord Europe image. Huge kudos to them.

## How to use the template

All you need is to import this repository inside your LaTeX project. All the formatting, the redefinition and the function are located in the .sty files. The **skeleton** file is an example of how to use the template to follow IMT Nord Europe rules to write an internship report. If you have more question I can recommand to follow this repository:
